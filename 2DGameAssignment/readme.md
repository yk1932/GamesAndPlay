For the 2D Game assignment, I chose to recreate a popular korean game that I used to play as a child. The objective of the game is for the character to avoid the falling obstacles from the sky and break the highest record. Whenever the character successfully avoids an obstacle, they gain a point. 


The game is composed of three main screens - main menu, game screen, game over screen.
